This project will provide an in-depth exploration of the sentiment analysis pipeline developed for analyzing Reddit comments. It will cover:
•	The multi-model approach using both RoBERTa and VADER models for sentiment classification.
•	The data collection and preprocessing methods employed to handle Reddit’s unstructured data.
•	The sentiment aggregation techniques used to derive meaningful insights from individual comments.
•	The evaluation of the pipeline's performance on different subreddits and discussion of key findings.
•	The challenges faced, limitations of the current approach, and potential avenues for future improvements.
