This project aims to develop a robust sentiment analysis pipeline capable of discerning the sentiment of comments across different subreddits. By analyzing sentiment, we can understand how various communities react to content, identify topics that evoke strong emotions, and distinguish between communities that are predominantly positive or negative in their interactions. This insight can be valuable for community managers, moderators, marketers, and social scientists interested in understanding online discourse dynamics.
